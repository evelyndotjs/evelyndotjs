# 🌏 Hello, world! I'm Evelyn 👋

I couldn't resist this cliche opening.
I work at Amazon where I do internal quality assurance to ensure the integrity of our marketplaces.<br>

Prior to that, I spent half a decade working in game development, notably at [Wargaming](https://na.wargaming.net/en) and [SEGA](https://www.sega.com/games).

Having spent years working closely with some great software engineers, I was always intrigued with the technical side of things but it wasn't until Feb 2021 when I actually committed to learning to code.<br>

🌱 I'm learning: React
