# 🌏 Hello, world! I'm Evelyn 👋

I work at Amazon where I do internal quality assurance to ensure the integrity of our marketplaces.<br>

Prior to that, I spent half a decade working in game development, notably at [Wargaming](https://na.wargaming.net/en) and [SEGA](https://www.sega.com/games).

Having been sandwiched between R&D and our users for almost a decade, I was always intrigued with the technical side of things but it wasn't until Feb 2021 when I actually committed to learning to code, partly due to the pandemic which allowed me to have a little wiggle room in obligations.<br>

Outside of work, I have a little human who keeps me busy. Work, family, code - I could really benefit from having more than 24 hours a day!

🌱 I'm learning: React, Mokoto
